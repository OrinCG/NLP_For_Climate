# NLP_For_Climate
Hello, this is my first attempt at getting into NLP / machine learning for myself. I'd like to start working towards helping with Climate Change and the environment. 
Not sure how that's gonna work if at all.

For now there are classes for the Model Data and Learner as per: https://hackernoon.com/the-mvc-for-machine-learning-data-model-learner-dml-8127d793f930

The current model I'm trying is FastText: https://fasttext.cc/

Thanks for reading!
